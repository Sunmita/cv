<p>Self love is open and honest validation.It is the biggest commitment; to get to know and accept yourself as you are.
<br>
 To fully experience life To FULLY experience life as it happens to you.
 More importantly, to continually seek ways to physically, psychologically, and spiritually grow from these experiences.<br>
 <strong>True self love is validating yourself</strong><br>
 It’s important to love yourself because of the simple truth that you cannot take care of others until you take care of yourself first.
 When you fully love yourself, this gives you the opportunity to move through the world with deeper compassion for others.
